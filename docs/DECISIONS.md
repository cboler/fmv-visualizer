# Architectural Decisions

This document records the architectural decision records (ADRs) for this project.

Each record outlines the context, rationale, consequences, and trade-offs of significant architectural decisions made in the codebase. Downstream projects derived from this starter should append their domain decisions to this log.

## ADR-001: Angular Standalone Components and Signals Architecture

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Legacy Angular applications relied heavily on `NgModule` containers and required complex state management libraries (NgRx, Akita) or extensive RxJS boilerplate for standard component state. Modern Angular provides standalone components, direct provider injection, and Angular Signals.

### Decision

- Use Angular standalone components exclusively (`standalone: true` default in modern Angular).
- Use Angular Signals (`signal()`, `computed()`, `effect()`) for synchronous UI state and reactivity.
- Reserve RxJS for streaming asynchronous events, debouncing, and cancellation scenarios.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Dramatically less boilerplate, faster build times, tree-shakable components, and clearer mental model for state updates.
- **Trade-off**: Requires developers accustomed to NgModules or heavy state stores to adopt Angular's native modern patterns.

## ADR-002: GitHub Pages Static Hosting with Dynamic Base Href and 404 Fallback

### Status

Accepted

### Context

GitHub Pages is a cost-effective, zero-maintenance static host for web applications. However, it presents two challenges for modern single-page applications:

1. Projects are often hosted at subpaths (`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`) rather than the domain root.
2. Static file servers return a 404 error when users reload or directly navigate to client-side routes (e.g. `/status`).

### Decision

- Dynamically inject the repository's base path during GitHub Actions deployment using `@actions/configure-pages`.
- Generate a `404.html` SPA fallback by copying `dist/.../browser/index.html` via `scripts/prepare-pages.mjs` during the build step.
- When GitHub Pages encounters a direct route, it serves `404.html` containing the Angular application bundle and correct `<base href>`, enabling Angular Router to initialize and display the requested route.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Complete repository-name independence; zero configuration required when creating a new repo; client-side routing works reliably on refresh.
- **Trade-off**: Direct route navigation briefly returns an HTTP 404 status code behind the scenes before serving the SPA shell. For static PWAs on GitHub Pages, this is standard and harmless.

## ADR-003: Vitest for Unit Testing and Playwright for Multi-Viewport E2E Testing

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Traditional Angular testing setups used Karma and Protractor (or heavy headless Chrome runners), leading to slow feedback loops and deprecated toolchains. A mobile-first PWA also requires validating rendering across physical device viewports to ensure no horizontal overflow or touch-target degradation occurs.

### Decision

- Use **Vitest** with JSDOM for fast, in-process unit tests (`npm test`).
- Use **Playwright** (`npm run e2e`) for automated end-to-end smoke testing across mobile portrait (375x667), mobile landscape (667x375), tablet (768x1024), and desktop (1280x800) viewports.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Near-instant unit test execution; robust visual and functional validation across real browser engines (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox).
- **Trade-off**: Requires maintaining both a lightweight unit test runner and a browser-driven E2E runner.

## ADR-004: Vanilla SCSS Design Tokens over External CSS Frameworks

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Many starters bundle large CSS utility frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap) that increase bundle weight, add build complexity, and impose opinionated styling abstractions that downstream projects often fight or replace.

### Decision

- Use vanilla SCSS structured with CSS Custom Properties (`src/styles.scss`) for color palette, spacing, typography, radii, and touch-target minimums.
- Rely on native modern CSS features: flexbox, grid, `:focus-visible`, `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, and `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Zero CSS runtime overhead, tiny bundle sizes, complete freedom for downstream applications, and native browser standards compliance.
- **Trade-off**: Requires writing semantic CSS rather than utility classes in HTML templates.

## ADR-005: Built-in Angular Service Worker for Offline PWA Support

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Progressive Web Applications require service workers to cache application assets and enable offline startup. Hand-crafting custom service workers introduces high maintenance overhead, cache-invalidation bugs, and manual versioning complexity.

### Decision

- Use `@angular/service-worker` configured via `ngsw-config.json`.
- Configure `appConfig` in `src/app/app.config.ts` to register the service worker when stable in production mode.
- Use the `prefetch` asset group for the app shell and the `lazy` group for secondary assets.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Robust, hash-based asset cache invalidation; automatic background updates; official Angular tooling support.
- **Trade-off**: Custom service worker logic (like Web Push or complex background sync) requires using extension hooks or integrating with Angular's service worker APIs.

## ADR-006: A separate local-first FMV derivation

Accepted, 2026-10-06. Clone the clean starter into fmv-visualizer and remove the clone's origin so the source starter cannot be pushed to accidentally. Preserve its PWA and Pages infrastructure. Native video and Canvas 2D cover playback and attitude; MapLibre, Turf and PapaParse provide the explicitly requested mapping, geometry and CSV functionality. A narrow native SRT parser covers labeled DJI cues without an additional subtitle dependency. Firmware variation is reported through warnings and documented limits.

## ADR-007: Explicit workers, bounded display, and offline schematic

Accepted, 2026-10-06. Copy MapLibre's worker/shared ESM assets through Angular's asset pipeline and configure setWorkerUrl relative to document.baseURI. This avoids dev-optimizer worker URL failures and makes offline/subpath caching explicit. Cap map updates at ~15 Hz and displayed breadcrumbs at ~2,000; retain every accepted record for interpolation. Ship a self-authored sample-region schematic and synthetic video. Online streets use a bounded on-demand tile cache. Files remain session-only; no remote persistence is introduced. The FOV represents a horizontal direction/spread sector, not a terrain-projected footprint.

## ADR-008: Complete bundled demo fetch before media decoding

Accepted, 2026-10-06. Public Pages verification exposed a race: a native media range request returned HTTP 206 before Angular prefetch finished, and Cache.put rejected it, degrading the worker. Fetch the small bundled demo as a complete Blob and play its object URL. Reuse existing URL cleanup, ignore stale sample completions after replacement/navigation, and leave large user videos as File object URLs. This adds a 3 MB demo download before initial decoding and avoids a custom service worker or dependencies.
