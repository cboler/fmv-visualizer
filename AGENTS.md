# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to this repository and any downstream applications derived from this starter.

## Repository Overview

- **Product**: Frame / Field — a local-first full-motion video and telemetry geospatial PWA derived from cboler/angular-pwa-starter.
- **Framework**: Angular (standalone components, inject-based dependency injection, and Angular Signals for reactive state).
- **PWA & Deployment**: Angular Service Worker (`@angular/service-worker`, `ngsw-config.json`), Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.webmanifest`), dynamic subpath base-href, and SPA routing fallback (`scripts/prepare-pages.mjs` creating `404.html`) via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
- **Architecture Style**: Client-side single-page application with zero server-side runtime dependency. Designed to be branched or forked into specific application domains.

> **For Derivations**: When building a new application from this starter, customize this section with your product name, domain description, and application-specific architecture.

## Commands & Quality Gates

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.

```bash
# Install dependencies reproducibly from lockfile
npm ci

# Start local development server with auto-reload (http://localhost:4200/)
npm start

# Run unit tests via Vitest (headless, single run)
npm test

# Run ESLint static analysis
npm run lint

# Check and fix formatting with Prettier
npm run format
npm run format:check

# Production build and GitHub Pages deployment preparation
npm run build
npm run build:pages

# Run Playwright multi-viewport smoke tests (mobile, tablet, desktop)
npm run e2e
```

## Agent Workflow & Documentation System

When planning and implementing changes, follow this structured documentation cycle:

1. **Consult Architecture**: Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand system boundaries, state management patterns, and static hosting mechanics.
2. **Consult & Record Decisions**: Check `docs/DECISIONS.md` before proposing architectural pivots. Record new non-trivial architectural choices as ADRs.
3. **Check & Update Roadmap**: Refer to `docs/ROADMAP.md` for project milestones and customization checklists. Update item status when features land.
4. **Execution Plans for Non-Trivial Tasks**: For multi-step features, architectural refactoring, or risky changes:
   - Create a plan in `docs/exec-plans/active/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` using the template defined in `docs/exec-plans/active/README.md`.
   - Implement step-by-step, validating against automated tests and real browser rendering.
   - Once verified and complete, move the plan to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
5. **Quality Gate Verification**: Never declare work complete without executing `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and testing locally in a browser.

## Guardrails & Invariants

All agents and contributors must preserve the following principles:

### 1. PWA & Static Hosting Integrity

- **Subpath Independence**: Keep the application deployable from subpaths (`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`) as well as root domains (`https://example.com/`). Never hardcode root-relative asset paths or router links (`/` instead of `./` or router link tokens).
- **SPA Fallback Preservation**: Never delete or bypass `scripts/prepare-pages.mjs`. Static hosts like GitHub Pages require `404.html` containing the Angular application bundle to support direct client-side route navigation and browser refresh.
- **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Preserve `@angular/service-worker` in `src/app/app.config.ts` and `ngsw-config.json`. Do not disable service worker caching in production builds.

### 2. Mobile-First & Accessibility Baseline

- **Mobile-First CSS**: Write base styles for narrow viewports first; use `@media (min-width: ...)` breakpoints to enhance tablet and desktop layouts.
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Ensure all buttons, links, and interactive controls maintain a minimum target size of 44x44px (`--touch-target-min`).
- **Safe Area Insets**: Support notched displays using CSS `env(safe-area-inset-top/bottom/left/right)`.
- **Keyboard & Focus States**: Retain accessible `:focus-visible` outlines (`--focus-ring`). Never suppress focus rings with `outline: none` without providing an accessible alternative.
- **Zero Horizontal Scroll**: Prevent accidental horizontal layout overflow across phone portrait, phone landscape, tablet, and desktop viewports.

### 3. YAGNI & Minimal Complexity

- **Native Standards First**: Use native browser Web APIs, standard HTML elements, and CSS custom properties before adding third-party libraries.
- **Angular Built-in Primitives**: Prefer Angular Signals (`signal()`, `computed()`) for reactive state and native control flow (`@if`, `@for`) over heavyweight state management libraries or unnecessary RxJS ceremony.
- **No Unrequested Boilerplate**: Keep components and services focused on their explicit purpose. Avoid speculative abstractions.

### 4. Derivation Guidance

- When converting this starter into a specific product:
  - Maintain the workspace, video player, canvas attitude HUD, telemetry service, and MapLibre viewer as focused domain components.
  - Rebrand metadata in `src/index.html`, `public/manifest.webmanifest`, and icons in `public/icons/`.
  - Update `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to reflect the new application domain while retaining the core operational rules.
